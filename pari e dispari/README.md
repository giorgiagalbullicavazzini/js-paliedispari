# Odd or Even

- The purpose of the code is to create a "Odd or Even" game;
- Thanks to two buttons, the user can decide between odd and even;
- Then, with an `input type text`, the user can choose a number between 1 and 5;
- Their choices will be saved in JS with some variables;
- Then, with a `function`, we can generate a random number between 1 and 5;
- With the creation of a second `function`, we can then do the sum of the two numbers;
- With a third `function`, we can finally check if the sum is odd or even;
- Recalling these functions, the result will be screen printed and the winner will be revealed.

# Palindrome

- The purpose of the code is to check if a given word is a palidrome one;
- Thanks to an `input type text`, the user can type a word;
- The word will be saved in JS into an empty array;
- Then, with a `for` loop, we can check all the letters contained in the given word;
- At the same time, we can also check all the letters from the end to the beginning;
- With a `function`, we can then compare the results of the two loops;
- IF these two are equal, the word is a palindrome one.
